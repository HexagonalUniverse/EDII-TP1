Makefile.

	. It seems that the OS pointed by makefile at windows 11 is windows NT.
	So it must be the case that there is retro-compability up to it; so any
	modern windows version should work equally with it. Is it the case for gcc?
	Is so, the product binaries doensn't need to specify up to the version of OS.
