STRUCTURE:
	. BTreeStream, BTree -> B_Builder
	>> The naming is less ambiguous. 
	>> We pass fewer arguments to lower functions.
	>> No longer it is have to be passed to BTree_Build, but rather there it is instantiated.


REFACTOR:
	. bnode_write, bnode_read -> write_bnode, read_bnode;
	same for bstar. The order of thir arguments also
	had been changed in the same sense. Same for bnode_retrieve / update.
	>> For naming concordance with write_regpage, read_regpage.
	>> Also for signature concordance.


DEFINITIONS & ORGANIZATION:
	. B_STREAM, REG_STREAM; all typedef'ing FILE.
	>> For more context of use and annotation.
	
	. Section "Pages" before Section "Frame" in <paging.h>
	 
	. retriver / update bstar. Integration bstar with the frame.


IMPLEMENTATIONS:
	. Integrated the indexed sequential search on to <pesquisa>.
